### Marker glow

Clickable markers have a soft silver glow by default.

Selected markers can use a stronger animated golden glow.
To apply it, add the `golden-glow` class to the marker in `index.html`:

```html
class="marker ijsbaan-marker gold-glow"


## Replacing images

Keep the same file name and replace the corresponding SVG or PNG 
inside the images folder.

Alternatively, update the src path in index.html.

## Deployment

The project is connected to GitHub and deployed through Netlify.

Changes pushed to the main branch are published by Netlify.

## Integration

The map can be embedded into another website using an iframe,

or the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images can be integrated directly
by the website developer.
